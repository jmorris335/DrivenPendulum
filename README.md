# Driven Double Pendulum Model
This repository contains a CHG model for a driven, double pendulum, primarily used for demonstration purposes.

## Install and Running
This package is built on [ConstraintHg](https://constrainthg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which is available on the Python Package Index. You can install this using PIP after creating a virtual environment:

```
    pip install constrainthg
```

After that, you can execute the model via the caller interface (`cli.py`). That script allows you to set the inputs and setup the pendulum simulation.
